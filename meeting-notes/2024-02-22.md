4. Updates from/since the last meeting
    - License discussion (Ben)
    - Github repository was created: [https://github.com/tdwg/standards-mappings](https://github.com/tdwg/standards-mappings) (This repo.)
5. Charter
    - [Charter Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1riceuu48IXzCDRYT1JovETDYVYfV7Nt0mt1xVEIdJSU/edit)
    - General agreement on the draft
    - to use of Github issues to structure the work and the related public communication, should be added
6. Roadmap
    - postponed to next meeting due to time issues
8. Any other business
    - Next meeting: preferably at the end of March at 20:00 UTC, as this is the last possible opportunity for Europeans and Australians to join at a somewhat reasonable time (21:00 in central Europe and 7:00 in eastern Australia, two weeks later the same time slot would be 22:00 and 6:00 respectively). 


## ToDos

- Move charter draft into this repo; convert to markdown in prep for:
  - final edits,
  - submission to Exec for approval, and
  - posting to website  (TAG needs at least a stub under Community for any Task Groups; Or we elevate this to its own interest group.)
- Find an additional convener to replace Holly? (She is stepping down because of increased demands at work, but will participate as time allows.)
